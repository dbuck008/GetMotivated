    <string name="app_description">Quotsy was made with one thought in mind:
        That if a picture is worth a thousand words, a motivational quote, an inspirational speech,
        or an uplifting statement has to be worth something as well. With that in mind, our team
        designed this app to allow users to place a widget on the home/lock screen of their phones
        or tablets that cycles through thousands of quotes in an attempt to make your day brighter.
        We would love to know what you think and if you have any questions/comments feel free to email
        us at dillon@arsu.net.\n\nThanks for using our app!</string>
